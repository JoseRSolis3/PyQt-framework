PyQt Framework v4

PyQt Framework v4 is a complete rebuild of my earlier PyQt Framework (v3).
This version focuses on cleaner architecture, improved verifiers, and modular design for scalability.
After learning from the complexity and legacy constraints of v3, I decided to start from a clean slate.
The result is a more maintainable, intuitive, and extendable framework for developers working with PyQt-based applications.

Key Features
Full suite of verifier functions for text, title, widget, and alignment
Clear logging for debugging and validation
Simplified widget management through dictionaries
Modular design ready for expansion (builders, handlers, etc.)
Freemium-friendly architecture (supports scalable add-ons)

Why Version 4
Version 3 served as a proof of concept. It worked, but it grew complex as new ideas were introduced.
Instead of patching the old system, I rebuilt the core logic to ensure clarity, modularity, and extensibility.
This rewrite makes the code cleaner, faster to debug, and easier to maintain.
